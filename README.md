Data 1:
Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report techniques
for studying physical activity in observational studies and clinical trials, 
largely because of their relative objectivity. During observation periods, the 
devices can measure MIMS in a short period; one-minute intervals are common. 
Because accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce 
around-the-clock observations.

This problem uses accelerometer data collected on 250 participants in the NHANES 
study. The participants’ demographic data can be downloaded here, and their 
accelerometer data can be downloaded here. Variables *MIMS are the MIMS values 
for each minute of a single 24-hour day starting at midnight.

- the education variable is categorical and should have a natural order of 
  - 1= less than h.s. 
  - 2= h.s. equivalent 
  - 3 = More than h.s.
  
Data 2:
Citi Bike is a bike sharing system in New York City; riders can rent pedal-powered
or electric bikes from starting stations and return them to another station at 
their destination. Introduced in 2013, the system is immensely popular and 
expanded rapidly. Riders who use this system often may become “members” with
lower rental rates.
