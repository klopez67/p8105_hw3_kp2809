Accelerometers have become an appealing alternative to self-report techniques
for studying physical activity in observational studies and clinical trials, 
largely because of their relative objectivity. During observation periods, the 
devices can measure MIMS in a short period; one-minute intervals are common. 
Because accelerometers can be worn comfortably and unobtrusively, they produce 
around-the-clock observations.

This problem uses accelerometer data collected on 250 participants in the NHANES 
study. The participantsâ€™ demographic data can be downloaded here, and their 
accelerometer data can be downloaded here. Variables *MIMS are the MIMS values 
for each minute of a 24-hour day starting at midnight.
